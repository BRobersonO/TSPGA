# TSPGA
Three Genetic Algorithms are formed, using three data representations (Hash Map, Adjacency, Matrix), to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem.
To Run the Genetic Algorithms, edit the hw1.params file (see notes in that file), then compile the code using javac, and finally run the code with the command java Search hw1.params
